# Sahyog: A Local NGO Website

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application for Sahyog, a community-driven NGO. The website is designed as a foundational digital presence to inform the public about the organization's mission, showcase its impact, and provide clear avenues for community members and supporters to get involved. The name "Sahyog" is a Hindi word meaning "cooperation" or "collaboration," reflecting the core principle of the NGO's work.
